# <a name="id-1"></a> Bathrooms/Showers

- Everyone should bring their own soap/shampoo/toilet paper/etc., and don't leave it behind for the next user.
- Sanitation between uses is required.

# <a name="id-2"></a> Fires
---
Most public and industrial fire restrictions are currently in place in order to reduce danger while fire fighting and prevention resources are limited. Oregonians are being asked to voluntarily refrain from outdoor burning while communities are responding​ to ​COVID-19. Current fire danger is Low, so we can have a small fire, but careful discretion is advised. 

# <a name="id-3"></a> Cooking/Food
---
Everyone bring your own food and beverages as well as any utensils required to prepare it; no sharing. 

# <a name="id-4"></a> Cleanup
---
Follow typical rules of camping; 
- Leave no trace on the landscape, which includes packing out all garbage.

# <a name="id-5"></a> General State Guidelines

All recommendations/rules by the State and CDC need to be followed:
- Anyone that suspects they've been in contact with someone who's sick should stay home.
- Physical distancing still applies in the outdoors. Plan on maintaining a six-foot distance from people outside of your immediate family
- You are 'encouraged' to have and wear a cloth face covering when interacting with others
