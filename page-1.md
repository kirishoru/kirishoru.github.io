[](The Elder Runes, a HeroFlix Tale)

# <a name="id-0"></a> Foreword
---

My name is Baelic al Faar, and I am a Hero.

…I hope…

I record this story in the vain hope that my legacy will be one of good and decency. I pray that my tale will be told to inspire rather than as a warning. But destiny cares not for the wishes of mortals, and though I am long lived, eventually I’ll find myself just as much a victim of time as anyone. At the end of my life, will this account be lost and forgotten? I will tell it anyway, if only for those that traveled with me. They at least deserve to be remembered.
  
The stories of others deserve to be told, but if not by them, then why not by me. I only hope I can do justice to their valor. But how can I convey with mere words the vanity, the foolhardiness, the bullheaded...tenacity? ...The bravery. The pure hearted altruism. The faith and majesty and greatness embodied by them all. Their splendor.

I know not. I will simply have to try. Bear with me dear reader; this chronicle will tell the tale of a group of heroes that saved…*everything*.

---

In order to begin, I must start at previous endings. For you, this requires a brief foray into my youth. As happens to many of my kind, I was abandoned as a babe. As a half-elf, my mixed features were likely a curse to both my parents. I have no memory of them and know nothing of their trials, but I must judge them harshly for their decision to abandon me near a human farming village. Though I have no memory of my parents, I have a great many in that humble village. A young couple took me in and showed me kindness. They raised me next to their own son. They taught me everything they knew and treated me in all ways as though I was their own flesh and blood. They taught me what it means to be a family.

When I they felt I was old enough to understand, my parents set me down and told me of my abandonment. I knew of course that I was a different; my almond shaped eyes, slighter frame, and lightly tipped ears set me apart from everyone else in the village. But despite knowing my nature, they continued to treat me as one of their children, and the entire village turned a blind eye to my differences, accepting me as one of their own.

The cruelty of my origin did not make itself known until many years later. My kind does not age the same way humans do and it was with great sadness I watched my parents and siblings grow old before my eyes. Eventually I buried my adopted parents when they died of old age, and then later, I buried my brother. The farm went to my brother with the passing of my parents and to his children after him. I worked my family’s fields with my nephews and nieces and then eventually with their children as well. I learned many of the crafts of the village and, leaving the farm to my brother’s descendants, for a time knew a sort of peace as the local leatherworker.

My life was a bliss of tranquility until the day a travelling seer passed through the village. The crone sat in front of what passed for a village tavern, quite honestly, it was just a stoop in front of the chandler's shop, and told the fortunes of people for a few pennies. She entertained the locals with bits of fancy - who would marry soon, who would be with child, the bounty of the next harvest. I was just as amused as everyone else. When I took my turn at her hands, I expected more of the same; a successful hobby of woodcarving, or scandalous rumors of some farmer’s daughter fancying the local half-elf. Instead, the moment the old woman's hands touched mine, her eyes went wide, and she spoke reverently of fate.

She said that the village son of two races would soon find two paths before him. One would lead to greatness and glory, the path of a hero. The other would lead to ruin of all that he touched, a bane upon the world. Then she said those most cursed words, "It is not for you to know your destiny,” she rasped, “only history will tell if your existence was as a paragon or a plague."

I shook my hands free of hers and quickly stepped back. Everyone tried to laugh off the dire telling, to distance themselves from cruel fate, but the festive air had cleared. The villagers all somberly went back to their day and the seer packed her things and left that very night. Two days later, the beginnings of my fortune were forced upon me.

--

What started as a normal day of straightening up my shop and preparing for the day quickly turned sour when a farmer rushed breathlessly into the square warning everyone about a marauding beast. This wasn't the first time a roaming bear or wolf had required handling and the village was well prepared. The women, children, and elders collected themselves in the square, or sequestered themselves in their homes, while a party of men, me included, organized to meet the threat.

As we headed south out of town the men split into two groups. We were to converge on one of the farmhouses that boasted the most chickens, knowing that the flightless birds had often proven a tempting snack for dangerous beasts in the past. One pair continued southward, the other larger group went east to attempt to circle around uphill from the farm. I was part of the pair that continued south. Farmer Adams and I were to take our time so as not to arrive at the farmhouse before the larger group.

Our haphazard plan crumbled at the sound of children's screams.

A sick feeling opened up in the pit of my stomach and I sprinted toward the farmhouse; Adams yelling at my back that we had to wait for the others. I paid no attention. I rushed across the yard to see the front door of the cottage already broken in and hanging by its hinges, terrified cries coming from within. Running through the ruined door, I saw an orc with greataxe poised above two children. The children no doubt thought the threat was a common one and had tried to get a peek at whatever would eat their chickens. Instead they caught the attention of the evil creature. The beast, its intent never on livestock, had found a tempting target.

The orc turned its evil glare in my direction, momentarily distracted from its dark intentions by my entrance. In that moment of distraction, I did the first thing that came to my mind. Terrified of what was before me, I ignored the feeble rake I had armed myself with and grabbed a nearby lantern from its hook. I threw the lantern as hard as I could and had the brief satisfaction of seeing it hit the creature directly in the face. My elation lasted for only the briefest moment, for the shattering lamp spread oil in a great swath on and around the orc. The flames spread in explosive greed to consume anything the oil touched. The searing heat as the ramshackle hut caught flame was immediate and horrifying.

The orc bellowed in pain as the flames scorched its flesh, but to my dread, the loudest screams came from the children.

They say that the mind will protect itself from true horror. That may be true for I have no memory of what came after. I am told Adams pulled me from the burning building only moments before it collapsed. The burns on my arms and hands testament that I had tried, in vain, desperately to correct the worst mistake of my life.

The next day, in the ruined remains of the farmhouse, the corpse of the perished orc was found. The village mourned as the bodies of two children were found as well. 

I waited for the looks and blame. I wanted it. I needed it. I craved for the parents to seek justice and vengeance for their lost children. But the orc was blamed for everything. No one looked at me as anything other than a hero. A hero that stood up against an orc with nothing but his bare hands.

I could not stand their gratitude. I could not reconcile my faithlessness to a community that had given me so much. Over the next few days, I tried to find a way of confessing to everyone the truth of what had occurred. But whenever the words started to touch my lips, their blind gratitude would still my tongue. Instead they rallied to help me. They took care of my shop, they brought me food, they tended my burns and gushed gratefulness at every turn. How could I tell them the truth when they thought I was a hero? How could I betray this village that had been so kind to me? My thoughts inevitably went back to the words of the seer. Was I a hero, or was I a plague? Surely the village will remember me as a savior, but what of my soul?

As the weeks passed and my burns healed, a sourness began to press on my spirit. The village was no longer a home to me. I could not pass the burnt wreckage of the cottage without hearing the agonized screams. Unable to regain my former peace, I sought the road to escape. I traveled from town to town, running from my shame. My ruined hands and arms mark me wherever I go as someone who has suffered. I can see pity in the eyes of strangers and I secretly wish they could see deeper, to the scars inside.

Though not pretty to look upon, my hands eventually gained back all of their former dexterity. I first forced myself to carve wood and work leather until the scars stretched, the pain it brought was a balm to me; sweet penance. But the pain didn’t last, so I forced myself to learn the flute, and then anything with a string, the agony of it the only atonement I could find. Now my nimble fingers dance over the strings, keys, and valves of a number of instruments. My clear voice and the sweet notes of my songs a bitter disharmony to the cacophony in my soul. Strangers applaud my stories and songs never knowing why I leave town so quickly. It is because their gratitude stings me like a physical wound.
  
I rejected my fate. I realized that any attempt to meet it will only end in sorrow for those around me. I sought not to be a hero hoping that if I perform no heroic deeds, I invite no catastrophic repercussions. Still, the road has no lack of bandits; my nimble fingers and tongue have entertained many innocent souls, and my dexterous hands and sword have put many of the not-so-innocent to rest in roadside graves. Despite my attempts, I am becoming more recognized wherever I go. Indeed, tales from my village are told in taverns now and I attempt to hide my scars so as to not invite recognition.

I still run from my destiny, but if I am destined to be a hero of stories, I can try to minimize the death that comes behind me. I entertain in towns and taverns, telling dark stories and bright tales. I sing of heroism and banditry and use my fair face and silver tongue to earn enough coin to see me on to the next town. But in the night, after those I’ve entertained have gone back safely to their homes, I can still hear the tortured screams of children in my sleep.

# <a name="id-2"></a> Endings and Beginnings
---

No rest will not come this night. Already I can feel the first tendrils of dawn approaching.

I rub my tired eyes and look over at the body of my friend. The poison that wracked his body through the night had finally done its work; his last breaths rattled from his tortured lungs hours ago. I had sat in silence for hours, numb to the passing of time. Now his cold form is the only reminder of my purpose here.

Here, as it happened, was quite beautiful. I had made a hasty camp at the rim of a vale. A small stream tinkled and weaved brightly across the open landscape. On the other side of the brook, near the center of the vale, a mighty oak, hundreds of years old, rose into the sky. Beneath it a small delicate bridge arched over the stream and beyond rose a small stone dais amidst the waving grass of an otherwise empty field. Atop the dais stood a pedestal lit in golden hues from some unknown source. The object of our – now my – quest, was there.

The undeniable beauty of this place was lost to me. The trials of getting here had taken too much. The world was gray, and everything tasted and smelled of ash.

All around the edge of the vale was the wall of dark briar forest that made up the terrifying labyrinth our party had traversed. Many long nights in its clutches, and the lives of everyone in the party, had been spent to reach its center and the priceless treasure found here.

I look again over again at the cold form of my friend. Farrow, a ranger from far north, had found me performing in the town square of Amphail. He’d heard that I was fluent in Halfling and wanted me to do a translation for him. Truth be told, my knowledge of the halfling tongue was only passing, but I was in need of coin and saw no reason to commit to truth-telling for a complete stranger.

He had shown me a ridiculously small leather scroll with ancient writing on it. My curiosity and the promise of payment got the better of me; I could not at the time imagine what treasure would cause a halfling to record something forever on a scroll…and then not keep that treasure for themselves. But the scroll told of an ancient and terrible labyrinth with a priceless artifact at its center, the labyrinth itself promised death and doom to all that entered it. Halflings may not be able to resist treasure, but they generally avoid doom.

Farrow admitted that he was looking to gather a group to help track down this ancient artifact. He himself had been commissioned by a fringe scholar of Halfling history named Kwalish. Kwalish had traced this particular myth for decades but was now too old to undertake the required travels to obtain it. Kwalish found Farrow, and then Farrow had found me. He told me that he had heard tales of my heroism and that I seemed like a perfect first addition to his party.

My curse is insidious. Only tales of my heroism are told and not a word of the death that comes with it.

Despite my aversion to outright heroism, I sensed another opportunity to prove that my existence was more boon than bane to this world and so I agreed to help Farrow assemble his group. Over the next few days we recruited from local guilds and taverns and found ourselves accompanied by as rowdy a group of adventurers as had ever existed. They were fairly exuberant to go on a quest for a fabled artifact.

After outfitting ourselves as best we knew, we set off into the wild searching for the foul labyrinth. For a time, I was happy and free of dread. Our travels were successful, and the challenges easily overcome. Those days seem so far away now. Though it has only been a span of days, perhaps a handful of weeks, I was lighthearted and free of fear. I even thought I might be able to look back on these days and enjoy a drink with these rough people. I would have called them all my friends, even the druid and her absurd crow…I would have…if they had survived.

--

When we first approached the labyrinth, I experienced a sick feeling in my bones and I knew. From the moment I saw its cursed gates, I knew that my fate again had reared its head. I trembled in fear at what would become of my new comrades, of my new friend Farrow. Despite the ancient warning, Farrow determinedly focused on moving ahead. The rest of us having no purpose without him, resolutely prepared to follow. We entered the gates.

Of the days and nights spent in that dark maze, most will remain unspoken. There is no daylight under the dark boughs of the labyrinth, so our first night spent in its clutches became one long endless night of terror. The first to fall, seemingly only hours after entering the dark gates, was our Druid. A wight surprised us in the darkness and before we even know of the danger, she was gone. The time blurred even more as we fled ever onward to the center of the maze. Danger and tragedy around every corner. The very maze itself seemed to be hunting us, leading us, tempting us with brief succor, before striking at us from the darkness, deadly and terrible. Eventually every one of our party fell, but Farrow and I remained. I could see the look in the eyes of my friend. Determination. Resignation. He knew we would not survive this journey. I knew that one of us likely would, and I mourned.

At long last, we came round a corner and beheld the exit. A dark arch, lit from beyond, promising safety and journeys end. After the trials we had suffered, even Farrow was at coming to the end of his bravery. He fairly sobbed with relief to see the gates and stuttered into a run. But the labyrinth is nothing if not cunning. A creature seemingly made of wind and poison and terror whirled into existence nearby and sought to destroy the last of our hope.

In the battle with the elemental that ensued, only pure luck allowed us to escape; I unscathed, Farrow, fatally poisoned. I dragged his insensible form through the gates and made a hurried camp. I tried desperately to save him, using every medicine, spell, and bit of herblore I knew. But as the night dragged on, and the fire grew dimmer, and as he grew weaker, my meager hope dwindled…and my friend breathed his last just moments before dawn, when everything was darkest. My fate is tragically poetic.

Now I lift my eyes from the face of Farrow and see the sky beginning to lighten. I stand up and dust off my legs, gather my belongings, and prepare to end this ill-fated quest. As the first breath of light simmers over the horizon, I walk down into the vale toward the great tree there. Its boughs firm and unswaying. A light breeze rustles it leaves.

The tinkling brook babbles lightly in the cool air as I walk under the tree toward the bridge. A filigreed construction of silver and crystal, the bridge sings in the sighing breeze, a beautiful counterpoint to the brook it spans. As I cross the bridge, I am blind to the wonder of its construction or beauty. My eyes focus on the end of my quest; the stone dais in the field beyond.

As I approach the dais, I see a set of crude stairs ascending one side and make my way there. The steps themselves and even the platform are unremarkable in form, the only notable thing being their presence in this place of beauty at the center of this larger place of horror. Thoughts of completing my quest for the distant Kwalish are faint in my mind. I no longer care. I climb the steps and walk to the pedestal at the center.

And a bitter laugh escapes my lips.

Atop the simple marble plinth lies the most beautiful instrument my eyes have ever seen. A dulcimer of surpassing beauty and undeniable magic. The golden body and delicate arch of its neck complimenting a perfect set of silver strings that fairly hummed with anticipation and potential. A faint, almost invisible golden glow emanated from its risonanza. After every trial, after every death, and every torment, to present me with this most perfect of bardic instruments. Surely my curse is mocking me.

Once again my presence has brought destruction. Once again I find myself the unlikely hero. The one that survives beyond all hardships and trials.

I sigh in resignation. I can no more resist this most perfect object than I could resist breathing, or gravity. I can feel it pulling at me. I can hear it calling to me. I feel as though I’m falling toward it and I watch my hands reach out to grasp its perfect neck. I pull the dulcimer to me and cradle it in my arms before setting my hands and striking a perfect chord on its perfect strings. The perfect golden sound that results doesn’t seem to even come from the instrument but emerges from the air and the ether and the heavens…and then everything disappears.

###### (2019.02.15)

When the room formed from the nothingness around me, the first thing I noticed was that the dulcimer was gone. This did not surprise me. What did surprise me as I looked down was that the burns on my arms and hands were completely healed, no trace remained. Even that one bit of justice has been denied me. Now there is nothing to remind me of my darkest deeds. No punishment for my crimes.

I bitterly mused about the cruelty of my path and then looked up to find myself in strange, but not unfamiliar, surroundings. Office-like in nature, though of a design I’ve never encountered. A strangely smooth ceiling and four comforting walls marked by two doors in the wall opposite me, and a set of double doors in the wall to my right. Several people in neat yet bizarre garments occupied a number of chairs against the two walls not marred by doors. The room contained several low tables between some of the chairs with brightly colored bits of paper spread atop them in a way that attempted, but failed, to be decorative. The setting seemed altogether like some form of reception room for a guildhall, though of what profession I could not say. Next to a glass tank containing several colorful fish, a man sat at a desk clearly making an effort to pretend he was the only person in the room. The clerk, if that is his profession, sat studiously staring at a box-shaped object with some form of magical light coming from the side facing him despite the presence of the motley crew all muttering in the various chairs around the room. There are some things that will always remain the same.

The various people in the room all began talking at once and I was hard pressed to keep up with what was being said. The most spirited discussion seemed to be coming from one group and it became clear that five of these folk had arrived together, though, I must admit, I questioned if their sanity had survived the journey intact.

While the five argued and frantically tried to make sense of their situation, one of the silent chair occupants stood and approached the man at the desk. He had a quick but clear conversation where the clerk named himself “Chad” and let the man know that if we wanted to leave, all he had to do was exit through the double doors.

The five stopped talking abruptly as soon as Chad began to talk and then turned as one to watch the man stride to the doors, throw them open, and hastily step through.
  
On the other side of the doors was madness.

A swirling vortex of color and dark and light that defied description or belief. No hallway or fading of vision, as if the fabric of existence had been cut away in the square shape of a door. The few moments that my eyes were exposed to that chaos was enough to set my head reeling and my stomach churning. Chad had told the man that through the doors was “anywhere he wanted to go”, but the thought of stepping through did not seem like an act of sanity.

The doors slowly swung back on their own, a near silent click as they closed, and the room was back to its mundane self again. The group of five was silent for a mere moment before they all collectively confronted Chad demanding to know what was going on. With a calm that clearly spoke of years of professional service dealing with the frantic and desperate, Chad loudly talked over everyone saying that we had been selected for our heroism and that “Duncan” would soon make everything clear.

Hearing this, and not wanting to spend too much time thinking about the doors leading to chaos, I resigned myself to waiting. As it happened, all of my gear and equipment had made the transition to the room with me, so I brought out my lute, briefly tuned the strings, and began to play a light but jaunty tune about boredom. Despite the strange circumstances, two of the people in the room decided the join me in my time wasting by dancing to my half-hearted strumming. The halfling in particular seemed to make an effort to dance sensually in my direction, but I averted my gaze not wanting to encourage him.

Around us, several of the people continued to argue amongst themselves about what to do, occasionally berating Chad for not providing them more information, while others waited patiently in their chairs. One of them seemed happy to simply smile and nod along with my music. Eventually, one of the people seemed on the verge of abandoning his comrades and turned toward the double doors. My fingers briefly faltered at the thought of seeing that maelstrom again, but before he could open them, one of the doors behind Chad opened up and a well-dressed charismatic man stepped through.

Conversation in the room stopped as the newcomer introduced himself as Duncan. Duncan wore a smartly lined set of pants and odd jacket of a matching color, a tightly closed collared shirt, and a bright length of fabric knotted around his neck. His strong jaw was thinly covered in a light dusting of beard as though he hadn’t seen a razor in several days, but for some reason the effect was rugged and handsome rather than slovenly. All in all, he was an impressive sight. Clearly someone who was used to the rougher side of the road and had only recently stepped away from adventuring himself. He invited us all to come to his office where he would explain everything.

I get slightly ahead of myself. I should take a few minutes to describe the important others in the room.

Jephanie Pepsi was a human and I could easily predict that she was familiar with a fight and could hold her own without trouble. Of all the assembled, she also seemed to be the only person present that was concerned with the “why” of our situation.

There was also a bald human named simply ‘Q’. He had almost left the waiting room through the maelstrom before Duncan had arrived. I could tell his impatience and impetuousness would cause no end of trouble.

A Dwarf named Mardred, or Margret, confused me at first. I couldn’t quite tell their name as they seemed to not know themselves. The dwarf was a weak and spineless creature altogether inconsistent with the hearty race I knew. Perhaps this was a different race altogether. I assumed they were merely confused by the circumstances and would return to typical staunchness soon enough.

The one that caused me the most disquiet was Adrien the elven wizard. With his high collar and low hood, I couldn’t tell immediately of what elven race he belonged, but I suspected him to be a High Elf. Knowing the feelings of elves in general and high elves specifically towards my own race, I worried what trouble this might bring.

The rowdy halfling was named Roscoe, and though I questioned his sanity -- he appeared to be only wearing some form of brightly colored loincloth and boots, like some gaudy troupe fool playacting as an effeminate barbarian -- this wasn’t all that different from other halflings I had met in my travels. They are a uniquely insane race. I enjoyed a brief conversation with him as we walked, even going so far as to mention my curse, knowing that no one would believe this deranged creature anyway.

Two others walked with us down the hall, but I paid them no heed as they stuck to themselves and did not deign to speak to the rest of the party. I had no knowledge of what had brought this group together in the first place or what bizarre providence had placed me in their midst so soon after the death of my friend. Loss and acceptance being my constant companion for the last several decades, I vowed to quickly catch up to what was happening around me and not be a hindrance. I would do my best to ensure my curse did not make victims of this group.

After a short walk down the solemnly lit hallway, we came to a solid door. Duncan opened it and ushered us all into a spacious office. The office itself was well appointed with several tasteful chairs for guests. One wall was covered in a floor to ceiling bookshelf containing numerous volumes of unknown content as well as several knickknacks and memorabilia, no doubt from Duncan’s adventured past. The room was dominated by a spacious expanse of desk, clearly made of the finest and rarest wood. Its surface sparsely occupied by a neat stack of papers, a cylinder containing an odd assortment of strange quills, and a box-like object similar to the one that Chad the clerk had been viewing in the previous rooms.

After we’d all settled in on one chair or another, Duncan began to tell us of the runes.

The runes, the known ones at least, were discovered accidentally centuries ago by Duncan himself, and when he arrived in this place-in-between-planes, an elder being was there to greet him. The Elder briefly showed him the way of the runes and how to use them, and then Duncan began to learn what the runes had to offer. Duncan learned that the runes contained a great power; the ability to transfer a person across the planes of existence. But even more, they opened up to a seemingly infinite number of planes. The thought of more planes that even described by the great wheel made my head spin. I couldn’t even remember all of the 26!

These planes, Duncan continued, are infinite in their variety, and besides being able to move people from plane-to-plane, the runes have the ability peer into these planes and observe. Even more, they have to ability to impart a measure of control of the circumstances of a person’s travel and arrival. My mind balked at this, though I could understand how travelling to another plane might alter a person’s being, I couldn’t understand how the traveler might alter the plane itself before arriving.

Eventually, after spending many years searching for runes, Duncan returned to the place-in-between-planes to find that the Elder was no longer present. Not knowing what to do next, Duncan started the organization which occupies the building I currently find myself. Here, in the organization which he calls “HeroFlix”, Duncan and his guild control all of the known runes and continue searching for more. I have no understanding of their skill or trade, but Duncan says that he sells stories across the infinite planes; stories of heroes, and more specifically, stories of a specific kind of hero; Rune Hunters.

The selling of stories is something I fundamentally understand and so I found myself listening intently to Duncan’s words, but though Duncan might be a seller of stories, and appears to be a man of integrity, something sinister began to infiltrate my thoughts. These runes are too powerful for one man, or even one organization to control. I even went so far as to ask Duncan about the danger they represent. Malevolence is common to all the planes, regardless of their orientation on the wheel, and if one malicious being gains control of a rune, they may use them to bring destruction to all of creation.

Despite controlling numerous runes and the organization spending centuries tracking down many of them, Duncan admitted that an unknown number of runes remain undiscovered. Our own arrival in the waiting room was the result of uncatalogued runes. Mormesk, a malign spirit, or wraith, was the first to discover and use the previously unknown rune in the Wave Echo Cave. The name of this place was unfamiliar to me, but based on the reactions of the others in the room, it held meaning to them. Further, the realization that the undead could find and use the runes gave even more credence to my thought that these runes were a discovery not meant for mortals, or even this existence.

After triggering the rune in Wave Echo Cave, Mormesk was transported to the HeroFlix guildhall, and by some miracle, was restored to his former mortal self in the process; a powerful and benevolent mage. Duncan indoctrinated Mormesk into the runes just as we were at that moment, and Mormesk offered to hunt runes for the guild. But once beyond the protections afforded by the in-between, Mormesk reverted back to a wraith. There, his undead form controlled his actions more than his rational mind and he would return to his more evil self. Though Mormesk had returned on several occasions to the in-between, and thence to his senses, the call of the runes could not be denied. Mormesk would eventually attempt to recover the Wave Echo Rune again, only to revert and lose control of himself once more.

Duncan is in desperate need of help. He confessed that it has been a long time since anyone has seen Mormesk and he fears the worst. Duncan then asked for our help. Will we help him find the unknown runes? Will we be heroes for his cause? Will we become Rune Hunters?
