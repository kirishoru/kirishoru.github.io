###### (2019.04.19)

After Duncan’s impassioned plea to become rune hunters for his cause, everyone seemed drained. Too much had happened too fast and we all needed time to realign with this new way of looking at existence. We tentatively agreed to help Duncan after getting some rest, and he concurred, saying that we’d all be shown to the rooms that had been prepared for us. 

I don’t know how they had rooms prepared for us when Duncan explicitly told us we had been unexpected, but I was sure the magic of this place had more surprises in store. A non-descript man in crisp but utilitarian garb met me outside of Duncan’s office and …

Thus passed the most relaxing and uneventful week of my life to date. Seldom have I known such luxury -- to peruse the library and study, to sit idly by the fire and pluck at the strings of my lute while sipping the finest wines -- but in the back of my mind I knew that eventually I would have to return. My destiny wouldn’t allow me to stay in the Nexus forever. The call of the runes and the danger they represent pushes against the back of my mind and cannot be ignored. 

During the week I also spent some time talking to Duncan about my life and how I reached the Nexus. After recounting my sad tale, he told me that my story reminded him of an inventor by the name of Kwalish who dabbled in extraordinary creations, both wonderous and terrible, and that both the labyrinth and the dulcimer sounded like something he would create. Of course, I knew that name. Kwalish was the name of the supposed halfling scholar that sent Farrow and I on our disastrous trip. I owed Kwalish a relic…and he owed me a life.

After several days spent idly perusing the accommodations of the Nexus, I received a note in my rooms requesting my presence in Duncan’s office that afternoon. Expecting to hear more about runes and hoping to finally take some action, I prepared myself for the possibility of a journey by gathering a few essentials and heading to the administrative side of the Nexus.

Duncan’s offices were as magnificent as I recalled. Every shelf was spotlessly dusted, the books lining them perfectly aligned. Even a sturdy looking crystal decanter filled with an amber liquor, surely of superlative quality, spoke of the care taken to maintain this room. Though, upon entering, I was lightly taken aback by the large fireplace framed by the bookshelves at the side of the room, a cheerful and cozy fire crackling in the hearth. I was absolutely positive there hadn’t been a fireplace on that wall the first time we had visited these offices. The mysteries of this place continued to amaze.

Several others trailed into the room shortly after I arrived including two I had seen before; Ardren the high elf and Millicen the hill dwarf. Two others introduced themselves as Saulk, a woodsy looking human, and Umifrar, a stout dwarf who introduced himself as “the Unmanned”. Everyone took a seat on the various comfortable chairs and couches in the room as Duncan came around to sit on the edge of his desk to address us.  

Duncan said that he’d found some information regarding the circumstances surrounding my unfortunate entrance to the Nexus. The inventor Kwalish, was last known to have set sail from the Port Nyanzaru on the northern Chultan peninsula of Faerun decades ago. I knew he could not still be there as my own ill-fated mission from him to the cursed labyrinth happened only weeks before, practically on the other side of Faerun, but in Nyanzaru we might find more information. If we could retrace his journeys over the last several years, we might be able to piece together a picture of the rune of the labyrinth as well as discover how Kwalish was connected to the runes at all. 

We were to seek out a gnomish map maker named Anexi, also known as “the Cartophile”. Anexi was a renowned cartographer who had also been searching for Kwalish and might know more of his whereabouts. Our mission was simple; seek our Anexi and ask him what he knew of Kwalish. Why we needed five people for such a simple request seemed strange to me, information seeking was something I was especially gifted at, but Duncan insisted that a full party was always required when rune hunting, even if it was only expected to take a few hours, so we acceded to his superior experience.

As this was expected to be a short and simple excursion, none of us required extensive preparation, though Ardren did go so far as to take the crystal decanter of fine liquor from Duncan’s desk. I’m sure Duncan noticed, but said nothing….and then we made our way to the waiting room where the ever-present Chad tapped away at his usual station. 

I prepared myself mentally for what was to come next. We had to pass through the portal. My heart thudded in my chest as Saulk casually pulled the double doors open. Easy for him, he’d been in the Nexus for several weeks and had been on several rune hunting missions before. The maelstrom of nothing awaited beyond the doors, even as my eyes attempted to twist away from looking, I could feel the presence of that chaos throbbing in my skull. I wrenched my eyes forward into the space-less space and put on a brave face

Duncan told us that the doors would take us just outside the city but away from anywhere inherently dangerous and that the “key” to return was a G5 chord; he winked when I looked at him in confusion before assuring me that it would makes sense when we arrived.

And so I took a deep breath, and stepped into nothingness…

Immediately I felt nothing. No body, no sound, no vision. I couldn’t even tell if I had fingers or hands anymore. I may have been just a mind drifting through the ether for an eternity. Eventually, though I could not tell time or even estimate duration, a sense of color started to return to me. Then sensation. Then shapes. Then feeling the weight of my body settle onto my feet as the ground appeared and the rest of the world faded into existence before my eyes. 

As my vision cleared, I noticed several things. First, the stiffness of my hands and fingers told me that my burn scars had returned. This gave me a strange feeling of relief; I had been running from them for so long that to have them taken from me had actually left me adrift. I found I had missed the persistent reminder of my past. Far more astounding however, in my scarred hands I held the magnificent dulcimer from the labyrinth. Its beauty stilled my heart again as I gazed upon its perfect shape. I longed to sit and play its strings, but I remembered Duncan’s final words to me and understood; this dulcimer wasn’t just a perfect instrument, it was also our gateway back to the Nexus. Somehow its perfect craftmanship embodied one of the elder runes. Casually roaming the world with an exposed rune made me nervous. I didn’t know who or what might recognize its potential, so I resolved to keep its secret hidden. I reluctantly slung the dulcimer over my shoulder and threw my cape over it in what I hoped was a casual way, attempting to mask its splendor with feigned indifference. 

Another thing I noticed was Umifrar. He had lifted his kilt-like garment and was looking intently at his groin; I was shocked that not only was he wearing nothing beneath the loose garment but that he would so casually expose himself. My shock was replaced with disquiet when I noticed he was completely smooth down below; the unmanned indeed.

We found ourselves in a grassy clearing on a steep hillside overlooking a small city surrounded by lush green jungle on a great bay that I assumed was Port Nyanzaru and the Bay of Chult respectively. My own knowledge of geography being a little rusty, this still was in keeping with what I knew of the southern parts of Faerun. We began our short walk to town following the directions Duncan had given us to find the mapmaker. He was to be found somewhere in the Merchant’s Ward. We traversed the gates and found ourselves in the western part of the city. After briefly asking for directions, we were told the mapmaker likely placed his storefront in the luxurious Grand Souk market. Traders and merchants from all along the Sword Coast came to this place to trade in the rarest of commodities. If Anexi’s maps were as good as his reputation indicated, this was where we would likely find him.

Without trouble, we found the shop. A small but elaborate sign proclaimed it as “Anexi’s Analogies”, and so we walked in. The shop was tidy as to be expected of such a niche professional in the wealthy part of the city, but the maps on display were magnificent in their detail. More maps than I had ever seen and covering more of Faerun that I knew existed. There were even maps displayed that I knew could not be of Faerun…did this man have maps of other planes?

A small professional looking gnome in a suit waited at the small counter and was about to warmly greet us when behind us the door to the shop burst open, and another gnome in some form of wheeled chair rolled stutteringly into the shop wailing at the top of his small lungs. He was yelling about how he was ruined, begging for help. We stepped aside in confusion as the chaired gnome rolled to the counter and started sobbing and crying to the shopkeeper…something about making commitments he could not fill, how his shop would revert to the banks, and he would be homeless and destitute if someone didn’t help him. 

I exchanged dubious glances with my comrades and gathered from this exchange that they were either family or friends of some kind. When I made questioning eye contact with the fellow behind the counter, he made a shamed face and apologized for his brother’s dramatics. He introduced himself as Anexi and the sobbing chair-bound fellow was his brother Graxi. He told us he would be with us as soon as he could, then turned again, attempting to calm his brother.

We stood around uncomfortably for a few moments as Graxi continued to sob and sniffle, stuttering out how he would never be getting the right mushrooms in time. Without wanting to interrupt, but still needing his assistance, I told Anexi over the sobbing heap of his brother that we were looking for information and that our time was not unlimited. He apologized again, talking over his bawling brother and said that when Graxi got like this there wasn’t much that he personally could do until he got calmed down. 

I frowned, suspecting that this display was something they had practiced, but inwardly preparing myself for the inevitable.
“Would it help if we offered our assistance?” I sighed. 

Graxi immediately calmed, turning his chair in our direction, his wet red-rimmed eyes glistening as he gazed hopefully in our direction. He said that our assistance would be greatly appreciated and that he would be deeply indebted to us if we could provide him with what he needed. He was an apothecary of some renown and had obligations to meet this very day. He just needed the final ingredients for his potions, some mushrooms that could only be found in the fairy grove outside of town. His usual sources were unavailable to retrieve the valuable ingredients because of other obligations, but if we could retrieve the mushrooms, he would gladly share with us some of the excess potions. Anexi then chimed in and said that he would happily provide us with information if he had it, free of charge if we helped his bother.

I glanced at my companions, resignedly took a breath, and then told Anexi that we agreed. We would help his brother in return for a share of some of the excess potions, a map of the area surrounding the city that included the fairy grove, and any information he could give us about Kwalish.

Anexi looked stunned at the mention of Kwalish, but then grimly nodded his head. “A deal’s a deal,” he said “It will take me time to refresh my memory of Kwalish anyway. Help my brother and anything I know I will tell you.”

Graxi started describing the characteristics of the mushrooms we were supposed to help him find while Anexi produced a rough copy of a more detailed map of the area that included the grove. The details inside the grove were unclear and Anexi apologized for that stating that Fey groves tend to change their layout making mapping near impossible. The map placed the grove a short distance outside the city with four entrances from the cardinal directions of north, south, east, and west. Graxi also noted that his usual suppliers each had their own methods for getting the mushrooms from the grove and that maybe we could ask them for instruction. This seemed like sound advice to me, so I noted the names of each supplier on the rough map as well as where they might be regularly found. They were Marin Peretta, a jeweler, Seprin Court, a minstrel, Azrak Mouzra, a local magister, and Len Sou Na, a toymaker.

As we left the shop, I scanned the list of names Graxi provided. I assumed that a magister wouldn’t put himself into much danger for mushrooms and so we decided to go and ask Azrak about how he gathered them from the potentially confusing and dangerous grove. He lived not that far away from our location on the edges of the ward and so we left to find his house. A few minutes later, unsure if his duties would take him from his home, I knocked at his front door. 

Azrak appear a dry and boorish man, clearly predisposed to monotonous city official work. When we asked him about gathering mushrooms for Graxi, he said that mushroom picking was a hobby of his and that he never had trouble with the dryads of the eastern grove. They disliked dishonesty and as long as you clearly stated your business and had no veiled intentions, they would typically offer you no harm.

I glanced briefly at my companions that I knew nothing about and remembered the elder rune shaped like a magical dulcimer I was making a poor attempt at disguising on my shoulder. I had doubts as to our ability to bypass the grove fey without trouble based solely on our depiction of "honesty". I decided we should ask a different one of Graxis’ sources.

My next best guess would be Seprin Court. I felt I knew my way around the minstrel profession and suspected that if this man could make it into the grove unharmed, so could I. Seprin supposedly was playing at a tavern a short distance away from Anexi's shop called the Glittering Dragon and we made our way there.

Upon entering the tavern, we were greeted by the typical mid-day crowds. A few scattered patrons sat eating their meals or drinking their drinks, a low hum of conversation rumbled through the room. A man sat on a stool near the fireplace casually strumming a lute and singing. The tune was one I was familiar with, a common request for a tavern minstrel. One always plays to the crowds if you want to earn your meals. We casually made our way across the room and stepped up to the sturdy wooden bar and I asked the barkeep if the man playing was Seprin. The kindly looking man confirmed that was him, so I ordered a drink. The rest of the party stepped up to the bar as well, each ordering their respective favorites. I suspected they were more than happy to take a time out from our mission for drinks.

As I sipped my drink, Seprin finished his song, put away his instrument, and then stepped toward the bar. As he came near, I complimented him on his playing and asked for a word. I told him that I appreciated his playing and was something of a minstrel myself. His eyes immediately fell on the dulcimer on my back and stared in awe before stammering out an introduction. I asked him about his forays into the fey forest to gather mushrooms and he fairly fell over his words telling me about how the southern entrance was guarded by a faerie dragon and a satyr, but both had a love of music, drink, and fine food, and so he’d never had any trouble gathering there. I thanked him for his time along with a promise to return sometime and play the magical dulcimer for him for which he was grateful. 

The rest of the party hearing about a satyr decided to fill their packs with extra liquor and some food from the bar, but I suspected the satyr was simply and excuse, they would have drunk regardless. Either way, considering the way Seprin had gushed over the magical dulcimer, I suspected word of our presence would soon be making the rumor circuit. I decided we should be making our way quickly in order to avoid any fuss. After gathering everyone up, we referenced Anexi’s map, and decided that the southern entrance used by Seprin would be the easiest for us to approach, and quickly made our way back out onto the streets. 

We made good time leaving the city and after an hour of walking the jungle trails, we found ourselves cresting a cleared ridge that gave way to a small valley. The trees in the grove looked somehow greener and more peaceful than any other stretch of jungle in sight. The sound of the breeze fairly sparkled as it blew across the treetops and butterflies could be seen floating about the greenery. Truly a magical place.

We descended into the valley and entered to grove from the south through a gap in the trees and shrubbery. There a small but clear path led deeper into the cool green tunnel of trees. Only after a few moments under the branches we could easily tell that this place was magical and protected. The oppressive heat of the jungle noticeably lessened to a cool comfortable level. An overwhelming sense of serenity permeated the air. Small creatures crossed the path in front of us without fear, and the breeze that ruffled our hair and sighed past our ears contained the sounds of tinkling laughter. 

Sensing the magic of this place, I brought out the dulcimer and began to play. Though the instrument itself was a potentially dangerous rune relic, I wanted it close to hand if we needed to make a quick escape. Besides, something about this place made me want to play music. 

As I began to play, Saulk started and stared at Ardren. It took everyone else only a moment to see a tiny blue dragon the size of a common housecat sitting on his shoulder. It’s eyes half lidded as it nodded along to the tune I was playing. Ardren, confused about what to do about the tiny creature, reached into his bag and offered it some food he had acquired from town. The dragon lightly nipped at the food before taking a larger bite and swallowing delightedly. Then it nuzzled into Ardren’s cheek, emitted a tiny pleased trill of sound, and promptly vanished. A smile played across my lips as the wonder of this place began to seep into my soul. We continued deeper into the grove, me playing a jaunty tune and everyone else peacefully walking ahead.

Further on the brush began to grow dense and off the trail to the right we could start to hear faint music, different from my own. The lovely lilting melody sounded delightful, so I made an effort to accompany it. The song was frustratingly hard and for a moment, I almost lost my composure, but something snapped within me and suddenly I could feel the soul of the music playing through me and the magical dulcimer. As my playing intensified, we peered over the brush to see a goat legged man with tiny nub horns playing a set of panpipes. He smiled broadly, beckoning us to join him.

The peace of the grove overcame our senses and we eagerly left the trail at his summons. As we crossed the brush, he stood and started dancing along to our combined music. Ardren and Umifrar offered the faun some of our drink which he graciously accepted, somehow enjoying the drink, yet never stopping dancing. I continued to play the theme of the music the satyr had started and soon he began to play along again. The song was so charming that when the horned man started to dance further into the forest, it never occurred to us not to follow. He danced along for several minutes all of us in tow, me playing along on the dulcimer. 

Eventually the music came to a break, and as if by magic, the short man vanished. Ardren and Umifrar looked around as though coming out of a deep sleep, both clearly confused as to where we were or how we’d gotten there. I belatedly realized that the fey creature had charmed them, and I had assisted. I hid my guilt by ceasing my playing and helping Saulk the ranger get our bearings. We quickly figured out how to return to the trail and I vowed not to get distracted again.

We continued back along the original trail deeper into the forest until we came to a small clearing. The center of the clearing was cut through by a sparkling stream lined with an incredible variety of mushrooms of all colors and sizes, from small to enormous, standing as tall as a man. In fact, several of the mushrooms appeared to man shaped. My jaw dropped as I realized that some of the mushrooms were I fact humanoid in shape and were walking amongst the other mushrooms, tending them.

We slowly approached the Myconid people and started quietly searching the ground for the mushrooms Graxi had sent us for. We spotted them in the creek on a small island in the middle of the stream. Not wanting to aggravate the strange mushroom creatures, Millicen asked if we could harvest some of their mushrooms in exchange for food and drink. The creatures responded in the strangest way; small puffs of spores clouded out of fin-like vents in their faces, and at the same time mellow voices could be heard in our heads. Promising some of the strong liquor Ardren had purchased form the barkeep in town was enough to convince the creatures to let us take what we needed.

While the party gathered the required mushrooms, I again played the dulcimer. I suspected its magic was beginning to affect me in ways I couldn’t understand. The music it produced seemed to weave its way into your soul; I was beginning to crave the feel of the strings on my fingers. It certainly had an effect on the fey creatures, and it seemed to be impacting the Myconids as well; they all stared raptly in my direction as I played, gently swaying in place.

My group completed their mushroom picking and managed to gather several Torchstocks, Waterorbs, Bigwigs, and Nilhog’s Nose; all the required ingredients for Graxi’s potions. We collected them into our various packs, and I trailed off playing the addicting music. We left the mushroom copse and returned back the way we came. The trail out of the grove was uneventful and we saw no more of the fey. As the afternoon passed, we eventually made it back to the city and made our way to Graxi’s shop.

We handed over the requested mushrooms and he was very grateful. He gave us several potions as thanks and then returned to the back of his shop to finish up his delayed orders. We left Graxi’s and made our way to Anexi’s Analogies once more. When we found Anexi, he thanked us for helping his brother and agreed to tell us everything he knew about Kwalish.

Years and years ago, Anexi had been searching for Kwalish himself. Kwalish had made several of the tools that Anexi used in making his wonderfully detailed maps and wanted to discuss with him the possibility of more tools. Unfortunately, he arrived in Port Nyanzaru too late to catch up with Kwalish. Kwalish had gathered a party and set sail on an expedition to the Barrier Peaks in search of the lost city of Deowin Glowigh. That was the last time anyone had seen or heard of him. That was 30 years ago.

My heart sank. I knew Kwalish was alive and active, he had sent my friend Farrow on the ill-fated quest for the very dulcimer I was carrying not more than a few weeks ago. But somehow the rest of the world lost his trail decades before. Anexi asked if we too were in search of Kwalish’s legendary laboratory, saying that it would be the find of a lifetime. I sadly shook my head and told him that our search was for other reasons but thanked him for his time.

I gave a nod to the rest of the party and they all circled around me right there in Anexi’s map shop. I brought out the dulcimer and -- tensing slightly -- played the chord that Duncan had said was the key to our return to the Nexus. 

The note struck on the magic strings and seemed to echo into the very fabric of my being, resonating into my bones. As the vibrations traveled along my skin, a faint numbness followed, and the world faded away before my eyes…
